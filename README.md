🎮 Tic Tac Toe Web Application — SCT_WD_3
This repository contains my Task 3 project for the internship at SkillCraft Technology, where I built an interactive Tic Tac Toe web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

🚀 Features
✅ Playable Tic Tac Toe game between two players (X vs O)
✅ Handles user clicks to place moves
✅ Tracks game state and switches turns
✅ Checks for winning conditions (rows, columns, diagonals) and ties
✅ Displays dynamic messages for wins or draws
✅ Fully responsive and clean UI design

🛠️ Tech Stack
HTML5 for structure

CSS3 for styling and responsiveness

JavaScript (ES6) for game logic and DOM manipulation

💡 What I Learned
Implemented game state management purely with JavaScript

Practiced event-driven programming by handling click events on each cell

Applied logic to efficiently check for win and tie conditions after every move

Improved understanding of updating the DOM dynamically based on user interaction

Enhanced my skills in building interactive and engaging front-end applications
